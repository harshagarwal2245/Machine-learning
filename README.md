**ABOUT THE PROBLEM**

We are given the data of direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. 
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (target variable y). 
This case study is inspired by this research paper where the researchers have used a very similar dataset 
as the one we will be using throughout this case study for determining the success of Bank Telemarketing. 
The researchers in their paper have mentioned that the best result they have got was a AUC score of 0.7 and 
a ALIFT of 0.7. So as a goal I had tried to produce a similar result inthis internship.

#**ABOUT THE DATASET**

As mentioned above, the dataset consists of direct marketing campaigns data of a banking institution. 
The dataset was provided by company itself. The datasets  consists of 41188 data points with 20 independent 
variables out of which 10 are numeric features and 10 are categorical features
